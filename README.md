# **Dynamixel Hardware Interface User Guide**

## **1. Introduction**
ROS 2 package providing a hardware interface for controlling [Dynamixel](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel/) motors via the ros2_control framework. This repository includes the dynamixel_hardware_interface plugin for seamless integration with ROS 2, along with the dynamixel_interfaces package containing custom message definitions used by the interface

## **2. Prerequisites**
![ROS 2 Humble](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS2-Humble-blue)

Before using this package, ensure the following dependencies are met:

  ROS 2 Humble Installation: This package supports ROS 2 Humble only. Ensure that ROS 2 Humble is properly installed (ROS 2 Humble installation guide).
Dynamixel SDK: Install the Dynamixel SDK using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-humble-dynamixel-sdk
   ```
Hardware Requirements:
  Dynamixel servos
  USB2Dynamixel or U2D2 adapter
  Proper power supply for Dynamixel motors.

## **5. Usage**

### **a. Controlling Motors**
Use ROS2 topics or services to send commands to the motors. For example:
- **Topic Example**: Publish commands to control motor positions:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub /dynamixel_command sensor_msgs/JointState "{name: ['joint1'], position: [1.57]}"
   ```

- **Service Example**: Call services to get motor states or change modes:
   ```bash
   ros2 service call /get_motor_state dynamixel_sdk_custom_interfaces/srv/GetMotorState "{id: 1}"
   ```

### **b. Monitoring Motor State**
Subscribe to the topic `/motor_states` to receive real-time feedback on motor positions, velocities, and loads:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /motor_states
   ```

---

## **7. Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Device Not Found**
   - Ensure the correct port is specified in the YAML file (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).
   - Check if the USB device has proper permissions:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
     ```

2. **No Response from Motor**
   - Verify the motor ID and baud rate match the configuration file.
   - Confirm the motor is powered and connected properly.
